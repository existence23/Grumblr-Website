To turn in homework 1, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

Feedback:
I made some changes of my wireframes according to the feedback I got.
1. Modify personal file page, add "Global Stream" button.
2. Personal file page: modify the outlook of personal info.

HTML:
1. Login page: Click "Sign Up Now" would link to sign up page
2. Sign Up page: Click "Login" would link to sign up page
3. Global Stream page: Click "Log out" would link to sign in page. Morgan is the username of the sample personal file, click "Morgan" would link to morgan's personal page
4. User Profile page: Click "Global Stream" would return to global stream page. Click "Log out" would also link to sign in page
