Thanks for Xiaoyu Qiu’s (andrew id: xiaoyuq) kindly help, she gave me some helpful suggestions. Here is the summarize of her questions/sugggestions.

1. How to go back to global stream page when in user’s profile page?

Actually I did not consider this problem before, I already modified in my UI design.

2. Find a larger world is underlined, is it a link to another page?

Actually it’s just a slogan, maybe the underline is confusing. But it would not show in blue color in the final view, since other link with underline may show in blue color.

3. What is the small span button in the down right corner of a post?

This is because of the screenshot problem. The small white button shows because of the text field is chosen and was cut in the picture.

4. Another modification by myself is add sample pic part in post, I did not consider picture could be included in posts.
